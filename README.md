Subject: use case on linear discriminant analysis using wines dataset
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
The aim of this case study is to carry out linear discriminant analysis for the given wines dataset. First we load the dataset and the 
libraries into the code. We then carry out data exploration activities like taking a peek at the data, studying descriptive statistics, 
class distributions and correlation between attributes. We further explore the data and then carry out data visualization using univariate
(histogram, density and box and whisker) plots and multivariate (scatter plot matrix and correlation matrix) plots. We then instantiate 
a model using LDA and then plot the components after dimensionality reduction as a scatter plot. Then we carry out cross validation to 
check for model accuracy.
